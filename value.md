# Value Propositions
### Value for Researchers
The Norwegian EOSC node creates value when:

* Researchers find datasets that they cannot find today
* Researchers spend less time understanding datasets
* Dataset quality is easier to assess
* Services for knowledge extraction from datasets are more accessible
* Developing new standards, quality-assuring data, and making them FAIR becomes more efficient


### Value for the Research Ecosystem
All those supporting researchers benefit from EOSC when:

* It becomes cheaper to offer relevant services, share data and publications
* It becomes more efficient to develop new standards, quality-assure data, and make them FAIR


### Value for Society
Society benefits from EOSC when:

* Companies get easier access to data, services, and publications from researchers
* Value creation from research and innovation increases

## The node will achieve these effects by


###Facilitate Collaboration Nationally and Internationally**
* A Norwegian EOSC node shall make it easier for Norwegian institutions to use each other's services and data products
* A Norwegian EOSC node shall make it easier to offer relevant services and data developed in other countries to Norwegian researchers
* A Norwegian EOSC node shall enable sharing of services and data in university alliances (Out of scope?)


###Make It Possible for More People to Access Small Specialized Services**
A Norwegian EOSC node shall provide sufficient "economy of scale" so that even small specialized services that the Norwegian research community needs or wishes to contribute to can be realized.


###Connect Data Across Disciplines**

A Norwegian EOSC node shall make it easier for researchers to use data across disciplines.


###Make It Easier for Researchers to Find Norwegian Data**
A Norwegian EOSC node shall make it easier for Norwegian and foreign researchers to find relevant quality-assured Norwegian data *in areas where there is no thematic node that addresses this*.
**NB:** Main principle for sharing data is through the thematic nodes.

###Make It Easier and More Cost-Effective to Operate Diamond Open Access Publishing Channels (out of scope?)**
A Norwegian EOSC node shall make it easier and more cost-effective to operate Norwegian diamond journals. This includes technical services for publishing, for "the process around it", for approval/quality assurance, channel registry.

This includes implementing the European - Diamond Open Access Standard.

**NB:** An impact of increased publication in Diamond journals is that research publications become more accessible to municipalities, counties, and the government. These do not have a mandate to support Subscribe to Open models and cannot afford to purchase access.


###Services for "Secure Access" to Open Data**

Even open data can no longer be completely open. Both discussions around dual-use and AI usage. Services are needed to ensure they are used for the intended purposes.

### Fix the Basics for Researcher-to-Researcher Collaboration
Services like eduroam, FileSender, and Zenodo have made cross-border collaboration easier. But researchers still face barriers with fundamental tasks.

**Example of Missing functionality:**
- **Simple data sharing** – Researchers need a "Dropbox for research" that works seamlessly across institutions and countries without complex setup

**Example of a Persistent problem:**
- **Cross-border authentication** – Login and access control across institutions in different countries remains complicated, blocking smooth collaboration


## A Norwegian EOSC Node Shall Not

###Make It Easier for Researchers to Find Relevant Datasets?**

Overview of research data shall primarily occur through the thematic nodes. We assume that a researcher interested in data from other fields will find the relevant subject matter experts/datasets themselves. However, a Norwegian EOSC node shall be able to help the two researchers collaborate on data from different data domains after the collaboration is established by having services that facilitate collaboration.


###Be a Common User Interface for All Norwegian Researchers**

Researchers shall primarily engage with the user interfaces offered by their institution or by the thematic nodes.



> **Discussion needed:** What other impacts and way of making them happen do we need to include?
