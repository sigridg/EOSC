# Value Propositions
## Value for Researchers

The Norwegian EOSC node creates value when:

* Researchers find datasets that they cannot find today
* Researchers spend less time understanding datasets
* Dataset quality is easier to assess
* Services for knowledge extraction from datasets are more accessible
* Developing new standards, quality-assuring data, and making them FAIR becomes more efficient

## Value for the Research Ecosystem

All those supporting researchers benefit from EOSC when:

* It becomes cheaper to offer relevant services, share data and publications
* It becomes more efficient to develop new standards, quality-assure data, and make them FAIR

## Value for Society

Society benefits from EOSC when:

* Companies get easier access to data, services, and publications from researchers
* Value creation from research and innovation increases

## The node will achieve these effects by

### Facilitate Collaboration Nationally and Internationally

* A Norwegian EOSC node shall make it easier for Norwegian institutions to use each other's services and data products
* A Norwegian EOSC node shall make it easier to offer relevant services and data developed in other countries to Norwegian researchers
* A Norwegian EOSC node shall enable sharing of services and data in university alliances (Out of scope?)

### Make It Possible for More People to Access Small Specialized Services

A Norwegian EOSC node shall provide sufficient "economy of scale" so that even small specialized services that the Norwegian research community needs or wishes to contribute to can be realized.

### Connect Data Across Disciplines

A Norwegian EOSC node shall make it easier for researchers to use data across disciplines.

### Make It Easier for Researchers to Find Norwegian Data?

A Norwegian EOSC node shall make it easier for Norwegian and foreign researchers to find relevant quality-assured Norwegian data *in areas where there is no thematic node that addresses this*.

### Make It Easier and More Cost-Effective to Operate Diamond Open Access Publishing Channels

A Norwegian EOSC node shall make it easier and more cost-effective to operate Norwegian diamond journals.

(Technical services for publishing, for "the process around it", for approval/quality assurance, channel registry).

European - Diamond Open Access Standard. Has begun translating to Norwegian and communicating to editors.

**NB:** An impact of this is that research publications become more accessible to municipalities, counties, and the state. These do not have a mandate to support Subscribe to Open models and cannot afford to purchase access.

### Services for "Secure Access" to Open Data

Even open data can no longer be completely open. Both discussions around dual-use and AI usage. Services are needed to ensure they are used for the intended purposes.


## A Norwegian EOSC Node Shall Not

### Make It Easier for Researchers to Find Relevant Datasets

Overview of research data shall primarily occur through the thematic nodes. We assume that a researcher interested in data from other fields will find the relevant subject matter experts/datasets themselves. However, a Norwegian EOSC node shall be able to help the two researchers collaborate on data from different data domains after the collaboration is established by having services that facilitate collaboration.

### Be a Common User Interface for All Norwegian Researchers

Researchers shall primarily actively engage with the user interfaces offered by their institution or by the thematic nodes.
