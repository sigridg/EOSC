## About This Document

This is a collaborative space for designing Norway's node in the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC). All contributions are welcome through GitHub pull requests or issues.

If you have suggestions for improvement or comments and do not have access to GitHub, please send an email to sigrid.gaseidnes@sikt.no

### About This Project

Over the next four months (November 2025 - February 2026), Sikt in collaboartion with the Research Council is conducting a systematic needs assessment to understand what a Norwegian EOSC node should deliver to actually serve Norwegian researchers and institutions.


### What We're Exploring

- How can Norwegian institutions more easily share services and data with each other?
- What are the barriers to international research collaboration around data and infrastructure?
- How can we make specialized services sustainable across institutions?
- What would actually make researchers' and support staff's work easier?

### Who Should Participate

We are seeking input from:
- **Research support staff** (libraries, research administration, data stewards)
- **IT departments** and infrastructure providers
- **Research infrastructures** (national nodes, ERICs, domain-specific services)
- **Researchers** across disciplines, especially those working with:
  - Large-scale data
  - International collaborations
  - Cross-institutional projects
  - Specialized infrastructure needs
- **Research leaders** with perspectives on institutional infrastructure needs

### Our Principles

**Transparency**  
Everything is documented openly here. All findings, analyses, and recommendations will be published as we go.

**Value Regardless of EOSC**  
What we develop must benefit Norwegian researchers regardless of the general development of EOSC. The need for better data sharing and collaboration tools exists independently.

**Broad Participation**  
We welcome input from anyone in the research community. You don't need to know what "EOSC" means to contribute – we want to hear about your actual challenges and needs.

**Semi-Structured Involvement**  
We're conducting systematic interviews with key stakeholder groups, but the process is open for anyone to engage through:
- Participation in Discussions and issues on this GitHub page
- by mail to or meeting with sigrid.gaseidnes@sikt.no
- by participating in the [Norwegian EOSC forum](https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/research-policy-strategy/open-science/eosc/)
