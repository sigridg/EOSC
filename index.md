### About This Project

Over the nex months (November 2025 - January 2026), Sikt in collaboartion with the Research Council is conducting a "semisystematic" needs assessment to understand what a Norwegian EOSC node should deliver to actually serve Norwegian researchers and institutions.


### What We're Exploring

- How can Norwegian institutions more easily share services and data with each other?
- What are the barriers to international research collaboration around data and infrastructure?
- How can we make specialized services sustainable across institutions?
- What would actually make researchers' and support staff's work easier?


### Principles for the mapping

**Transparency**  
The main findings are documented openly at this webpage and will be continously developed as we go. 

**Value Regardless of EOSC**  
What we develop must benefit Norwegian researchers regardless of the general development of EOSC. The need for better data sharing and collaboration tools exists independently.

**Broad Participation**  
We welcome input from anyone in the research community. You don't need to know what "EOSC" means to contribute – we want to hear about your actual challenges and needs. And what possibilities you see in this field

**Semi-Structured Involvement**  
We're conducting interviews with key stakeholder groups, but the process is open for anyone to engage through:
- Participation in Discussions and issues on this GitHub page
- by mail to or meeting with sigrid.gaseidnes@sikt.no
- by participating in the [Norwegian EOSC forum](https://www.forskningsradet.no/en/research-policy-strategy/open-science/eosc/)

### Timeline
November-December: Interviews and input collection
January: Discus the findings with EOSC forum and other stakeholder groups
